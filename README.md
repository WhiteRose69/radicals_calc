# radicals_calc
This tool will help you to calculate what number on what power is your number.
For example you choose 256 -> The result will be 16 power of 2 wich is 256 ,4 power of 4 which is also 256 and 2 power of 8.
I am a lazy person so i don't want to think and calculate because it takes time but with this program you need a few seconds.
Good luck .
P.s It's a simple code and my first on github so don't be cruel.
